Make sure to put the script properly, you can follow a deeper tutorial on how to do so here: https://help.aidungeon.com/scripting.

This Script is free to use, just make sure to tag the scenario it under #AIttributes so other people can find it!

You’ll need to use a PC to install a script, if you can't really do so because of your own reasons feel free to use the own example scenario, it's setted up so players can get some full control over what the story is anyways.

You can get the codes on this github, just use the little menu on top of this readme

Step-by-Step Guide:
- Go to AI Dungeon and log in.
- Click "Create Scenario" to make a new one — or choose an existing scenario to edit.
- While editing your scenario, click the DETAILS tab at the top.
- Scroll all the way down and click EDIT SCRIPTS.
- You’ll now see several tabs: Library, Input, Context, and Output. Follow the steps below for each one:
